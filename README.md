# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. It provides a quick and easy way to set up a new React project with a pre-configured development environment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload whenever you make changes to the source code.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests) documentation for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include unique hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the [deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment) documentation for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the default configuration and build tool choices, you can eject from Create React App. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and allow you to have full control over your configuration files and dependencies.

Please note that once you eject, it's a permanent operation and can't be undone. You should use this feature only when you're ready to take full responsibility for the project configuration.

### Code Splitting

Code splitting allows you to split your code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on-demand. Learn more about code splitting in the [code splitting documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/code-splitting).

### Analyzing the Bundle Size

Analyzing the bundle size helps you understand the size of your app and optimize it for better performance. See the [analyzing the bundle size documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size) for more details.

### Making a Progressive Web App
